            <p>The research program <b>Future Well Ageing - a community based program for Prevention and Intervention using welfare technology for a healthy everyday life</b> is based on the research groups earlier results and concepts used. The most relevant ones are summarized below.</p>

            <p><b>WELFARE TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
			<p>Welfare technology is a part of e-health and is digital technology that aims to maintain or increase security, activity, participation, support, or independence for a person who has or is at increased risk of having a disability. Digital technology contributes to a large extent to the home becoming a new arena for health to support independent living and prevent or supplement care and care needs. Digi-physical care is based on the Good quality, local health care reform act that shows the need to develop technological support systems that integrate digital and physical meetings in the care that is available to the care receiver (Swe: vårdval). According to the National Board of Health and Welfare, welfare technology should be introduced and used in accordance with the criteria that exist for Good quality, local health care. </p>  
			<p>The care must be knowledge-based, safe, accessible, efficient, equal, and based on the needs of the individual. Still, research is needed to study the use of different welfare technology for older adults, their significant others, and the staff. In our research program, we see digital technology as a tool (not only for care but for all actors) that needs to be relevant, lead to participation and preserve dignity. The purpose of using e-health solutions must not be to reduce older adults’ opportunity for togetherness or meetings within health and social care, but rather to make these meetings more effective and rewarding for all parties, including aspects of dignity.</p>

            <p><b>ENGAGING EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES</b></p>
			<p>Activities that the person wants and needs to do in their everyday life and are identified by older adults are known as engaging everyday activities. Daily activities will be used in the prevention intervention as well as supported by the homecare staff. They could include personal care activities (described as fundamental skills required to independently care for oneself, such as eating, bathing, and mobility), productive activities (as transport, grocery shopping, paying bills) or leisure activities (as participating in social and cultural activities and events). How these needed and desired everyday activities are performed can impact older adults’ health. Daily activities that include standing and moving may produce health benefits, but the engagement component needs to be added to increase the value and experience of well-being. The WHO guidelines for physical activity and sedentary behaviour recommend that older persons limit the amount of sedentary behaviour and replace it with physical activity of any intensity (including light intensity that many engaging everyday activities offer) for health benefits. Sedentary behaviour is defined as any awake behaviour done while sitting, reclining, or lying down that requires no more than 1.5 metabolic units of energy expenditure4. Physical activity, inactivity and sedentary behaviour among older adults receiving prevention and reablement services have been given little attention in research.</p>

			<p><b>REABLEMENT</b></p>
			<p>Reablement is a well-tested social and health-care approach used in internationally established homecare services. Reablement involves a person-centred approach and is provided by homecare staff in collaboration with health care professionals. The aim of reablement is to “enhance an individual’s physical and/or other functioning, to increase or maintain their independence in meaningful activities of daily living (ADL) at their place of residence and to reduce their need for long-term services. This is done, in partnership with the older adult and possible significant others, by providing sufficient support for the older adult to do the daily activities that they need and wants to do (i.e., engaging in everyday activities). Reablement services are beneficial for quality of life and appear to present cost-effective solutions. Reablement is in line with the European Commission’s recommendations that their member states implement support to older adults to manage their everyday lives as independently as possible. Unfortunately, reablement is not widely established nor thoroughly tested in Swedish conditions. Our previous feasibility study evaluating ASSIST 1.0 shows an excellent potential for the service and the need for further testing. Existing homecare services are plagued with several problems (e.g., lack of resources, under-financed, short turn-around in staff) threatening the provision of home care, and a lack of documented best practices. Reablement could solve some of the issues threatening the quality of homecare in Sweden today.</p>

			<p><b>PERSON-CENTRED CARE</b></p>
			<p>Person-centred care respects the older adults’ choices, participation, influence, and autonomy. The person is respected as an individual with needs, values, and preferences. In all our projects, we will emphasise the rights of older adults and their individual choices and goals as a component of successful healthy ageing. Essential outcomes from the person-centred approach are: </p>
			<ol>
			 <li>the intrapersonal component, which is when a person perceives control, mastery, competence, motivation and initiatives to engage in behaviours’ to influence desired outcomes,</li>
			 <li>the interactional component, which encompasses health literacy, i.e.,  having relevant skills and knowledge to achieve control and to navigate in the system, as well as skills that help individuals become independent,</li>
			 <li>the behavioural component, which comprises empowered behaviours as a result of person-centred care and actions taken to master or influence specific outcomes (e.g., living independently, joining a group/association, adapt to changes in everyday life).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Person-centeredness should be provided in collaboration between the older adults and health professionals, based on the needs and preferences identified by the individual. Furthermore, it should be coherent (i.e., coordinated with smooth transitions between different settings) and should contain goal setting, intervention/training, support for social participation, discharge support and continuous evaluation. Using goal setting is essential to stimulate volition and for participants in an intervention. In the program, full respect for the individuals’ choice of goals will be emphasised, and the older adult will be encouraged to identify goals regarding valued engaging everyday activities and domains in everyday life, including social functioning. The theoretical foundation shows the inherent relationship between the environment, everyday activities, and personal functions. </p>

			<p><b>CO-CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION</b></p>
			<p>To develop and implement interventions using digital solutions in health and social care the research needs to include the end-users (i.e., the older adult, significant others, the staff working within health and homecare service as well as the management) early in the process as well as study the mechanism and factors within the implementation process. In this program, we will continue our previous research and the use of the Medical Research Councils (MRC) guidelines including ADAPT as a framework for the different projects. The ADAPT guidance will be used when adaptation of interventions for implementation and/or re-evaluation in new contexts will be needed. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research have identified 5 dimensions essential to an intervention:</p>
			<ol>
			 <li>intervention (e.g., evidence strength and quality);</li>
			 <li>outer setting (e.g., regulations and resources);</li>
			 <li>inner setting (e.g., culture, leadership engagement);</li>
			 <li>individual characteristics; and</li>
			 <li>process (e.g., plan, evaluate and reflect).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The different dimensions will be used when describing and analysing the outcomes of the interventions used in the program.</p>
