            <p>There is still a knowledge gap regarding consequences of using different types of welfare technology and how this technology can promote an active everyday life and healthy ageing for older adults living with frailty. Moreover, there is also a lack of knowledge about how support for significant others and care partners best can be organized. This requires new ways of working, the development of work methods and the implementation of interventions since the home is becoming a new arena for primary health- and homecare.</p>
			<p>This programme is based on previous research where we have developed and tested several digital solutions. The next step is to use existing knowledge for continued development, implementing and evaluating of the interventions and working methods.</p>

            <p><a href="../wps/wp1.html">Project A</a> will be modelling a prevention intervention from the results of one study that has evaluated an intervention for persons with risk for stroke (FORTE Dnr 2020-00175) and an additional EU project called POSITIVE where a monitoring system for preventing older person frailty was tested in Poland, Spain and Sweden. In project A, we will now use engaging everyday activities and welfare technology solutions in prevention to treat/maintain frailty through a home-monitoring platform and a communication system between patients, significant others, healthcare professionals and physicians. </p>
			<p>In <a href="../wps/wp2.html">project B</a> the ASSIST program that have been tested in a feasibility study with promising findings (FORTE Dnr 2016-07089) will be evaluated in a full-scale trial. In addition, the project will be based on a current development of a program theory for rehabilitation at home that is based on an ongoing scoping review (Re@home, FORTE Dnr 2021-01791). </p>
			<p><a href="../wps/wp3.html">Project C</a> is based on earlier research where promising effects of the Music Care intervention framework for improving the well-being of older adults with dementia living at home and their care partners were found. This study established strong feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of the intervention and the methodology for collecting reliable biomarker data. One-fourth of the participants had decreasing evening cortisol, accompanied by decreasing morning cortisol levels, and an improved ratio between cortisol and DHEA-s, indicating an improved balance between energy mobilisation and regeneration that equates to lower stress. These physiological changes were also captured by standardised measures and self-reports of reduced stress and improved well-being, thereby supporting the use of this protocol and standardised outcome measures in population-based studies, where the time-consuming and expensive use of biomarkers is not feasible. </p>
			<p><a href="../wps/wp4.html">Project D</a> is designed to integrate and build on knowledge across projects as well as serving as a coordinating project for collaborative methods in intervention design and implementation across the program. In this program, co-creation will be used with stakeholders to identify and design user-friendly and effective ways of delivering interventions in projects A - C. Stakeholders such as older adults, their significant others, care partners, homecare staff, healthcare professionals, and managers will be actively engaged along the continuum of the program. This research will create new knowledge in different context as developing methods and working methods as well as cooperation between different actors. </p>
			<p><a href="../wps/wp5.html">Project E</a> will with a purpose to transform knowledge from project A, B, C, D into a generally improved care and concern for the older adult create a system model for implementation strategies of digital solution relevant in a Swedish context. </p>
