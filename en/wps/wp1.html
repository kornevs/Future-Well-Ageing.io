            <p>In this study, a Digi-physical multimodal prevention program based on a combination of physical group meetings and supportive welfare technology will be used to prevent and treat frailty. A home-monitoring platform and a communication system between the older adult, significant others and primary healthcare staff will facilitate communication, support, and preventive measures. The development of the technical system emerged from the increasing need to develop innovative solutions to improve the delivery of health care for older age groups in Europe, but also to improve cost-effectiveness in treatments. The physical meetings will be based on previous studies within the research group and navigated together with staff in primary health care.</p> 
			<p><b>The project aim</b> is to promote health and participation in engaging everyday activities in older adults at risk for frailty to increase quality of life and delay need for home care. In the project, we will develop and evaluate the effect of a technological infrastructure that enables a new organizational model for primary health care with a focus on the prevention and improvement of frailty involving two relevant stakeholders: the older adults and medical staff in primary health care. The idea of the monitoring platform and communication system is based on a tested system called POSITIVE with the possibility of supporting older adults with frailty still living at home without home care, or who are at risk of developing frailty, to maintain their ability when facing declines in intrinsic capacity. Through participation in a group-based prevention program, timely medical interventions and an online physical exercise programme older adults can potentially improve well-being and quality of life, reduce incidence of falls, falls and hospitalisations, and increase the feeling of safety in everyday life.</p> 
			<p><b>The research question</b> addressed in the project is: Can a multimodal prevention intervention i.e., ACTIVE@HOME supported by a technical support system maintain or improve older adults’ physical performance, cognitive functions, mood, independency level in ADL, participation in engaging everyday activities, quality of life and reduce the number of falls?</p> 
			<p>The expected result after receiving the intervention is that the older adults will have a decreased or maintained a stable frailty, increased performance, and satisfaction of doing everyday activities, a greater level of self-efficacy and quality of life prolonging the need of formal caregiving.</p>

			<h3>Study design and research setting</h3>
			<p>Based on our earlier studies the multimodal prevention intervention to prevent frailty for older adults supported by a technical system will be adapted, implemented and evaluated/tested with older frail people who live at home. The project will be connected to an academic primary healthcare centre, Stockholm Sweden. The project consists of several studies, first to develop the intervention program in close collaboration using participatory methods with stakeholders i.e., frail older adults, primary health care staff and leaders). A prototype will be evaluated in 10 frail older adults in close collaboration with a primary health care centre. The next step will be to model ACTIVE@HOME in a pilot study with a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) design to study the feasibility of the design and methods to evaluate the effects. To develop knowledge concerning the implementation, how and when to use and integrate the prevention intervention, qualitative studies will be conducted during and after the pilot in an urban area of Sweden. Furthermore, an evaluation of the clinical and the cost effects on a group level will be conducted.</p> 
			<h3>Intervention and implementation of the program</h3>
			<p>This project will include a pragmatic, randomised, wait-list-control trial with blinded outcome assessment. The intervention group (n=20) will receive a medical review, nutritional recommendations and an exercise program including five supportive 90 min group sessions to promote participating in engaging everyday activities as delivered from the primary health care centre by an interprofessional team (nurse, dietitian, occupational therapist, and physiotherapist). In addition, the intervention group receives a mobile or web application as part of the technical system with measurement tools for physical tests performed at home. A nurse at a local primary health care centre will then follow the participants in the intervention group during a six-month period with the help of a digital remote system and, if necessary, be able to support the older adults with messages within the system. The waiting list controls (n=20) will receive the same treatment after 6 months as a control. Implementation will be monitored using reflective diaries (to be filled in by staff), data from the monitoring system and based on interviews with participants.</p> 
			<h3>Methods of data collection and analysis</h3>
			<p>The evaluation will use both qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as a process evaluation regarding the usability, acceptance, and compliance of the proposed technical system. The physical training program will be monitored through registration in the system but also through qualitative interviews with the older adult, their significant others, and participating staff from the primary health care centre. The intended outcomes are the optimization of perceived participation in engaging everyday activities to maintain or reduce frailty among older adults. Pre and post-test evaluation of primary outcomes (frailty) and secondary outcomes (functioning and participation in ADL, self-efficacy, life-satisfaction, contacts with the primary health care, costs) will be conducted prior to and after completion of the intervention and implementation. Web-based applications of the assessment instruments as Red-cap will be used to collect data. The goal is to evaluate the design, recruitment, methods, and procedures to further develop the methods to calculate for a full-scale RCT.  The overall results of the project will be a prevention model facilitating a person-centred, efficient, and relevant prevention of frailty and knowledge of implementation strategies needed in different settings.</p>
