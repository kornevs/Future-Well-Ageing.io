                 <p>Music-based interventions have been shown to affect hormone levels, influence the autonomic nervous system and neurotransmitters, help maintain cognition, and alleviate anxiety, depression, and challenging behaviors associated with dementia. Even low-tech, non-tailored music interventions have a positive effect, though they may not be scalable. Despite technology being one of the fastest-growing and most effective means of delivering large-scale interventions across various settings (e.g., home care), there is a lack of knowledge about how to combine technology with evidence-based outcomes from analog interventions. Additionally, there is a systematic lack of involvement of end-users not only in the experience of technology but also in how technology fits into daily life.</p> <p><b>The research question</b> addressed in the project is: How and which technologies (e.g., online music programs, digital apps, virtual reality) can be beneficial for older adults with frailty, including dementia, and their care partners?</p> <h4>Effects of Music-Based Interventions</h4> <p>Music-based interventions have been shown to have a range of positive effects on older adults, particularly those with frailty and dementia.

			<h3>Study Design and Research Setup</h3> <p>Care partners (e.g., spouse, partner, adult child, or friend) are an essential support for older adults with frailty living at home. The ability to age with dignity at home depends not only on professional services but also on care partners and well-integrated welfare technology. Consequently, strategies to promote and maintain health and well-being among care partners are a critical area that requires non-invasive, cost-effective, culturally adapted, and broadly generalizable interventions. This project will leverage insights from previous research while also identifying where we need to go to optimize the use of established and new technology to reduce stress for care partners. Furthermore, we are aware that there are unique circumstances regarding the caregiving burden for care partners. The challenges associated with being a care partner for frail older adults with dementia present several issues that require special attention. To be effective, all technology chosen for use in dementia care must have a unique combination of characteristics that go beyond what may be needed for general medical conditions without impacting cognition. Therefore, this project will also strategically include partner dyads where one person lives with dementia.</p> <p>The project will use an iterative co-creation design in three steps with multiple stakeholders. In the first step, a database of participants from a previous study will be used to recruit partner dyads where one partner lives with dementia at home. In step two, care partner dyads will be recruited from project <a href="../wps/wp1.html"><script>document.write(projectA_eng);</script></a> and <a href="../wps/wp2.html"><script>document.write(projectB_eng);</script></a>. In the third step, participants from steps 1-2 will be used along with snowball recruitment of other stakeholders. The research environment will consist of various parts of the Stockholm area. Sessions may be organized at one of our partner organizations to offer locations close to participants' homes.</p> <h4>Care Partners and Their Role in Elderly Care</h4> <p>Care partners, such as spouses, partners, adult children, or friends, play a crucial role in supporting older adults with frailty living at home. The ability to age with dignity at home depends not only on professional services but also on:</p> <ul><li>Care from care partners</li> <li>Integration of welfare technology to support both the older adult and the care partner</li></ul> <h4>Need for Support for Care Partners</h4> <p>It is essential to develop strategies that promote the health and well-being of care partners. To be effective, these interventions should be:</p> <ul><li>Non-invasive</li> <li>Cost-effective</li> <li>Culturally adapted</li> <li>Generally applicable at a broad level</li></ul> <p>The project will build on previous research and identify areas for optimizing the use of technology to reduce caregiver stress.</p> <h4>Unique Challenges in Dementia Care</h4> <p>Being a care partner for older adults with frailty and dementia involves specific challenges. The technology used in dementia care must have unique characteristics such as:</p> <ul><li>Being specifically adapted for cognitively impaired individuals</li> <li>Going beyond what is needed for other medical conditions without cognitive impact</li></ul> <p>Therefore, the project will strategically include care partners where one person lives with dementia.</p> <h4>Research Environment</h4> <p>The study will be conducted in various parts of the Stockholm area.</p>

			
			<h3>Methods for Data Collection and Analysis</h3> <p>In the first step, focus groups will be used to explore experiences of a music intervention conducted with individuals living with dementia at home and their care partners. The interviews will focus on experiences of participating in the music intervention, the extent to which participants continued to use the resources from the intervention after it ended, and any personally experienced strengths/weaknesses/future wishes related to the music intervention. The total number of potential participants includes 32 dyads who participated in the music intervention.</p> <p>In the second step, workshops will be used to engage older adults receiving home care and their care partners in a generative data process to explore different types of welfare technology that are useful for delivering a music-based intervention. A combination of exposure to technology, technology trials, focus groups, visualization, and design thinking methods will be employed to generate data focusing on critical elements that can inform the potential benefits of 1) technology in delivering the intervention, 2) technology as accessible, 3) technology as effective, and 4) the need for support in using technology. Field notes will be taken, and interviews and group discussions will be recorded.</p> <p>In the third step, workshops will be conducted where stakeholders from various backgrounds are invited to discuss and prioritize the options developed during steps 1-2. It is expected that some services and technologies will receive low priority from many participants while others will receive high priority from different groups. This diversity will provide insights for further exploration, design, and prototyping.</p> <h4>Step 1: Focus Groups with Participants in the Music Intervention</h4> <p>The focus of the interviews will be:</p> <ul><li>Participants' experiences of the music intervention</li> <li>The extent to which they continued to use the intervention's resources after its conclusion</li> <li>Personally experienced strengths, weaknesses, and future wishes related to the music intervention</li></ul> <p>The total number of potential participants includes 32 dyads who previously participated in the music intervention.</p> <h4>Step 2: Workshops to Explore Welfare Technology</h4> <p>The aim is to investigate different types of welfare technology that can be used to deliver music-based interventions.</p> <p>The methods used in these workshops include:</p> <ul><li>Exposure to technology.</li> <li>Focus groups and visualization.</li> <li>Design thinking methods.</li></ul> <p>Data will be collected focusing on the following elements:</p> <ol><li>The utility of technology in delivering the intervention</li> <li>The accessibility of the technology</li> <li>The effectiveness of the technology</li> <li>The need for support in using the technology</li></ol> <p>During the workshops, field notes will be taken, and both interviews and group discussions will be recorded for further analysis.</p> <h4>Step 3: Workshops with Stakeholders for Prioritization and Further Design</h4> <p>The goal is to:</p> <ul><li>Identify services and technologies that are deemed to have high or low priority from different participant groups.</li> <li>Explore the diversity of opinions and needs that emerge in the discussions.</li></ul> <p>The results from these workshops will provide a basis for further exploration, design, and prototyping of technical solutions.</p>
